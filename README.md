## Introduction <a name="introduction"/>
I wanted to create this app to teach myself **TailwindCSS**, Google's **Firebase** database and authentication services, and **TypeScript**. I'm happy to say that I learned a lot about each of these tools during the creation of the app, and while it's not completely where I want it to be I am still quite happy with the result.
